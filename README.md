# MFid: Mechanical Firmware Index

A behavioral fidelity metric for evaluating how firmware-like a software-defined system behaves under real-world conditions.

## Why MFid?
Traditional metrics like uptime and latency fail to capture behavioral integrity. MFid introduces a new axis of measurement: trust through consistency.

## Components
- Whitepaper
- MVP telemetry engine (Node.js + WebGL)
- Example use cases
- Scoring methodology
