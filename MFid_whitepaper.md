### Abstract

The Mechanical Firmware Index (MFid) is a proposed behavioral fidelity metric designed to evaluate whether a software-defined system behaves with the same deterministic integrity as **mechanical systems**. In an era dominated by cloud-native, AI-assisted, and embedded systems, MFid provides a novel lens for assessing system trustworthiness by measuring consistency, timing integrity, and behavioral variance under real-world conditions.

Unlike traditional metrics such as uptime, latency, or throughput, MFid emphasizes the **consistency and predictability** of system behavior across a range of operating conditions, particularly in edge cases or degraded states. MFid has immediate applications in proximity systems, voice/video communication, real-time telemetry, and safety-critical embedded platforms.

### 1. Introduction

Modern infrastructure increasingly relies on systems that appear reliable during sales and acquisition process but are, in fact, highly variable in behavior once put to real world tests. As software-defined systems replace deterministic hardware, the need arises to assess not only whether something "works" but whether it works **consistently**, like firmware.

MFid fills this gap by offering a practical and conceptual framework to measure system behavior fidelity in operational environments. This document introduces the MFid concept, its motivations, calculation models, and real-world applications.

### 2. Problem Statement

- Uptime is not enough. Systems may be available but behaviorally inconsistent.
- Latency is insufficient. Low latency does not guarantee **temporal precision** under load.
- Traditional QA and unit tests cannot predict behavioral collapse during edge conditions.

**Examples of behavioral failure without catastrophic fault:**

- A BLE-based car unlock system fails due to ambient noise or unexpected range deviation.
- A voice-over-IP session desynchronizes by 200ms during network jitter, causing degraded trust.
- A software-controlled pump activates 100ms too early due to scheduler jitter.

These are not *crashes*. They are **trust failures** — and MFid seeks to measure their predictability.

### 3. MFid: Concept and Definition

**MFid (Mechanical Firmware Index)** is a composite score (0 to 100) that represents how firmware-like a system's behavior is under varying runtime conditions.

**Dimensions of Measurement:**

- **Temporal Consistency:** Variance in timing precision (e.g. audio sync drift)
- **Behavioral Integrity:** Deviation from expected response patterns
- **Real-World Deviation Margin:** Measured delta between ideal behavior and observed behavior
- **Recovery Fidelity:** How consistently a system returns to ideal state after fault injection

---

### 4. Methodology (Early Model)

#### MFid = 100 - Σ(Weighted Deviations)

Example deviations:

- Response time jitter (ms)
- Action delay under load (e.g. unlock delay)
- Event frequency variance (e.g. dropped packets or retries)

Deviations are mapped to impact severity and weighted accordingly.

Tools like packet sniffers, custom telemetry hooks, and system-level trace logs can collect this data in real time.

### 5. Use Cases

#### a) **Proximity-Based Systems**

Measure unlock fidelity, signal degradation, recovery variance. Applications: Smart locks, wearables, guardian-child presence trackers.

#### b) **VoIP / Audio Sync Systems**

Measure audio drift, echo delay, sync recovery during jitter events. MFid can flag conversational trust breakdowns.

#### c) **Virtual Desktops / Remote Access**

Measure UI lag variance, click-to-render delay, session reconnect consistency.

#### d) **Autonomous Control Systems**

Drones, vehicles, or manufacturing robots require behavioral guarantees in real-world conditions. MFid is a candidate for safety scoring.

### 6. Implementation Strategy

1. **Build MVP Telemetry Engine**
   - WebGL-based UI for real-time visual MFid score
   - Node.js backend with data ingestion, normalization, and score computation

2. **Pilot on Known Systems**
   - Example: measure MFid of BLE lock vs. custom RF system

3. **Open GitHub Repository**
   - Reference implementations
   - Real-world logs and sample MFid score maps

4. **Publish Findings**
   - Whitepaper, GitHub, IEEE submission
   - Engage with NIST and standards bodies

---

### 7. Conclusion

MFid is a call to rethink what system reliability means in the age of abstraction. As we entrust increasingly critical decisions to software-defined platforms, the cost of behavioral uncertainty rises. MFid offers a new axis for clarity — not just if it works, but **how faithfully** it works.

The goal is not to replace existing metrics, but to **augment our understanding** of system integrity with a behavioral trust score: the Mechanical Firmware Index.
